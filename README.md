I have setup this repository to hold my Machine Learning training problems created using Scikit-learn in Juypter Notebooks. The repository currently contains: 

* Classification using Naive Bayes Algorithm 
* Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Clustering using K-Means Algorithm
* Linear Regression using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
* Recommendations with Collaborative Filtering using Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
* Predict Diabetes with Python Machine Learning

This is an active repository
